# YellowBookProject-TheBank
My version of a project from a C# learning book

This is a bank project inspired by the The C# Programming Yellow Book. One of the C# learning books I have completed.

The bank is a console app that holds the bank Gringotts. Basic functions such as adding accounts and editing accounts via a a console user interface.

The project needs the following resource files to run:
CurrentBuild.txt
Bankdata.txt
BankTemporary.txt

If no files are found the program will autocreate files and initialize them for an empty bank.
